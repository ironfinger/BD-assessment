# What is an RDD

- Resilient Distributed Dataset
- These are the elements that run and operate on multiple nodes to do parallel processing on a cluster. 
- These are immutable elements which means once you create one, you cannot change it. 
- You can apply multiple operations on these RDDs to achieve a certain task:
    - To apply operations on these RDD's there are two ways:
        - Transformation and Action

- Transformation: Are applied to create a new one (filter groupBY and map)
- Action: These are the operations that are applied, instructs spark to perform computation and send the result back to the driver.



# Key value pair
- Spark provieds special types of operations on RDD

# RDD Transformations: 
- Resilient Distributed Dataset -> one of first fundamental data structures
